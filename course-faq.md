## Vectorization

An essential tool for writing machine learning tools in high-level
languages such as Python, Matlab, R, etc., is vectorization.  That is,
using built in operations for multiplying matrices, vectors, and
arrays, rather than coding it yourself with loops.  Some people have
found Justin Johnson's [Nympy Tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/)
helpful, but please share additional recommended resources.
## Partial Credit and Concept Mastery

I receive a lot of questions and comments related to partial credit on
tests.  Specifically, that we don't award enough of it.  This is
what's going on:

There are many small, individual concepts in the course.  Part of what
makes the class challenging is that there are so many different things
to master.  I want to assess the fraction of these many little
concepts you have mastered. My perspective is that if you only
partially understand a concept, or if you give an answer that vaguely
resembles the correct answer, but is not actually correct, then you
don't have a skill or a piece of knowledge that's actually useful.

For example, if you can write down an objective function that's mostly correct, but you dropped a few symbols (e.g. a "square"), there are 2 possibilities: 1) you don't really know how to write the objective, or 2) you know it, but in the panic of the test, you made a careless mistake.  A grader has a bit of leeway to give partial credit to cover the 2nd possibility, but not the first.  If you write the empirical risk correctly but not the regularization term, you don't know the objective function for ridge regression.  No credit for that concept. 

There IS one use for partial understanding: partial understanding is a useful starting point for continued study.  It's easier to get to mastery if you already "kind of" understand, than if you're starting from 0.  But to get there, you have to actually finish the job of mastering the material.

I think you'll be surprised how much easier it is to remember something once you've fully mastered it.  In any case, once you master something, I always recommend that you write a note to your future self, explaining the concept.  This should be somehting you can read in 6-12 months (or years, eventually) when you need that mastery, but you've forgotten the details.  You'll have trouble writing the note if you don't fully understand the material, so it's also a good self test.  I have 100s pages of these types of notes, and I have find them immensely useful over the years.
