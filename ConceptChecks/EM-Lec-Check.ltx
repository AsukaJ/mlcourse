\item Be able to give and factorize the joint density $p(x,z)$ for this problem.
\item Be able to give pseudocode for the EM Algorithm for GMM (as in slide 29).
\item Be able to state the relationship of EM for GMM to k-means.
\item Be able to set up problem (in terms of observed Xs, unobserved Zs, and parameter theta).

\item Be able to give EM algorithm pseudocode (as in slide 27).
\item Explain how we can compute the two arg maxes needed in this algorithm (i.e. using bound on KL divergence).
\item Be able to show that EM gives monotonically increasing likelihood.
\item Be able to summarize variations on EM, including generalied EM (address optimization in ``M" step), and restriction to a set Q of distributions (addressing optimization in ``E" step).

\subsubsection{EM Question}

\textbf{Poisson Mixture Model Setup}: Consider the poisson mixture model, where each data instance is generated by
\begin{enumerate}
\item Drawing an (unobserved cluster) $z$ from a multinomial distribution $(\pi_1,\cdots, \pi_k)$ on $k$ clusters.
\item Drawing a count from a Poisson distribution with PMF:
\[p(x; \lambda_k) = \frac{\lambda_k^x e^{-\lambda_k}}{x!}\]
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Problems}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $x, z$ be the count and cluster assignment for a single instance. Factorize $p(x,z)$.
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol 
\[p(x,z) = p(z) p(x|z) = \pi_z \frac{\lambda_z^x e^{-\lambda_z}}{x!}\]
\end{solution}

\item For a single data instance, we observe $x$, and want to know its cluster assignment $z$. Basic probability review: give an expression for the conditional probability $p(z|x)$ for a single instance $(x,z)$ (just in terms of probability expressions $p(\cdot)$.
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol 
\[p(z|x) =\frac{p(x,z)}{p(x)}\]
\end{solution}

\item Give an expression for the marginal distribution for a single observed $x$, $p(x)$ (marginalizing out $z$), in terms of probability expressions $\pi_k$ and $p(x; \lambda_k)$.
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol 
\[p(x) = \sum_{z=1}^k p(x,z) = \sum_{z=1}^k \pi_z p(x; \lambda_z)\]
\end{solution}

\item Now recall the EM algorithm. In the ``E step", we evaluate the responsibilities $\gamma_i^j = p(z = j | x_i)$ for each $j \in \{1,\cdots,k\}$. Give an expression for this responsibility for cluster $j$ and instance $i$.
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol 
\[
\gamma_i^j = p(z = j | x_i) =  \frac{p(x_i; \lambda_j)}{ \sum_{z=1}^k \pi_z p(x_i; \lambda_z)}= \frac{\pi_z \frac{\lambda_z^{x_i} e^{-\lambda_z}}{x_i!}}{\sum_{z=1}^k \pi_z \frac{\lambda_z^{x_i} e^{-\lambda_z}}{x_i!}}
\]
\end{solution}

\item In the ``M step", we will update our MLE estimates for $\pi_z$ and $\lambda_z$. Give an expression for $\pi_z^{new}$
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol 
\[\pi_z^{new} = \frac{n_z}{n} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \gamma_i^z}{n}
\]
where $z_i$ is the hard cluster assignment.
\end{solution}


\item Give an expression for $\lambda_z^{new}$. Recall the MLE for a Poisson $\hat{\lambda}_{MLE} = \bar{x}$.
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol 
\[\lambda_z^{new} = \frac{1}{n_z}\sum_{i=1}^n \gamma_i^z x_i
\]
\end{solution}

\item Let's apply the distributions we just described for the ``E step" of a toy problem. Imagine $k=3$, and we have $\lambda_1 = 1$, $\lambda_2 = 2$, and $\lambda_3 = 3$. Find $p(z = 2 | x = 1)$ in terms of $\pi_i$ for $i$ in $\{1,2,3\}$. Hint: Note $p(x)$ is constant for all $k$, so its straightforward to give proportional expressions for each of $p(z = k | x = 1)$ then normalize.
\begin{solution}
\item[]\Sol 
\begin{align*}
p(z = 1 | x = 1) &\propto p(x = 1 | z = 1)p(z = 1) = \pi_1 e^{-1}\\
P(z = 2 | x = 1) &\propto p(x = 1 | z = 2)p(z = 2) = \pi_2 2 e^{-2} \\
P(z = 3 | x = 1) &\propto p(x = 1 | z = 3)p(z = 3) = \pi_3 3 e^{-3} \\
&\\
P(z = 2 | X = 1) &= \frac{\pi_2 2e^{-2}}{\pi_1 e^{-1}  + \pi_2 2 e^{-2} +  \pi_3 3 e^{-3}}
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
\end{enumerate}
